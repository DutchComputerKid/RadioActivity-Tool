Built in 2019 as a school project with .NET 4, now released as a .NET 3.5 ported application. This was used as a learning ground for Visual Studio 2008. 
The source code is commented and if you transfer the code to a Win32 platform all you have to do is rebuild the GUI. The code is copy/pasteable.

### Installation
You can either build from source, (That's what the CAB project is for) or install the pre-compiled CAB package.
Included in the repo are the redistributables for Windows Mobile and Windows CE.

To install, first install the redistributable for your device, then install the RadioActivity-CAB.cab file. Transfer it to your PDA and open in Explorer. Done!

Note: For Pocket PC 2003 and lower, you may require the Messages redistributable. This is also in the redistributables folder.
These are in various languages, and wm stands for Windows Mobile. Older devices will need the non-wm cab file. 
More information will pop up in the requirements error upon install.
